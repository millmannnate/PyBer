# PyBer
## Overview of the analysis
This analysis was an exploratory project looking at ride sharing services. We were comparing different location types in this analysis to allow PyBer to improve access and affordability in each area.
## Results
Total fares by city type goes from highest to lowest in the order of urban, suburban, and rural. Urban areas see the most use from ride sharing and have the most drivers. Suburban areas have the second-most usage and drivers. Rural areas come last in all categories behind the suburban and urban areas. The average fare per ride and per driver is flipped, where it's the most in rural areas and the least in urban areas. 
## Summary
A recommendation to the CEO would be to push for drivers to stretch one area type out. It would help the access problem by having more drivers available for those less dense area types. Another recommendation could be to lower fares associated with rural and suburban rides to incentivize people to use ridesharing more.
